To get the graphs of each of the question you need to exit out of the current figure and then the next one will come up.

Building AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR all seemed to have the downward trend that we wanted.
With the XOR learning I'm not sure if there just wasn't enough trials to see the line bottom out and trend up again, or if the
formula was incorrect. But I understand that the single-layer NN would be unable to properly distinguish the outputs to the error
level that we would want.
